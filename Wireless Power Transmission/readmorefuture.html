          <h2 class="w3-opacity"><b>Wirelessly powered home appliances :-</b></h2>
	  <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now moving towards the future, where we will be having a power transmitting device inside our house which will allow us to transmit power to all the appliances present inside the house such as Television, Laptop, Lamp, Iron, Sound Box, Fridge, Mobile, etc. Transmitting devices transmit power while the appliances will receive that power through receiving devices set up inside into all appliances. That will make it easy to charge multiple devices at the same time. We don't need to stick with wires while using any electric device like mobile, laptop, camera, etc. entire elimination of wires is feasible with the aid of using WPT so the gadget turns into very consumer-pleasant, and complexity may be reduced.</h5>

	  <h2 class="w3-opacity"><b>Wireless power supply from the power station :-</b></h2>
	  <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the future, clean and green power generation may be done using renewable sources of energy. and power may be supplied to our houses wirelessly. Power transmitting antenna connected with the power supply station converts electric power into a microwave then transmits it to the nearest dual-mode power receiving and transmitting antenna which transmits this microwave to the nearest antenna which is connected nearest to the house. The house has its power receiving antenna which converts this microwave into electrical power. This electric power is then utilized by houses. Microwave wireless power transmission could supply power to places that are difficult to reach. Small communities in rural areas could be supplied with power using Wireless power transfer.</h4>

          <h2 class="w3-opacity"><b>Wireless control of drones power :-</b></h2>
	  <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the future, drones may be used in fire extinguishing. And these drones may have to carry the water pipe and set the pipe to an exact location and help in extinguishing the fire but in some circumstances the drone has to work for a long hour where the area under the fire is larger during those situations continuous and a large amount of power supply is required to operate the drone. During that situation an wireless charging system may be useful where on one side it will get charged and on the other side it can extinguish the fire. It will not only be helpful in fire extinguishing it will also be useful during the use of drones for a long time. The drone is very useful because the places people cannot access the drone can, and In an emergency, it is not possible to have the drone connected to a wire and charge it, so this process will be a better solution for it.</h5>
          <img src="Future 4.png" class="center"><br><hr>
	  <h2 class="w3-opacity"><b>Wireless charging of electric vehicle using power beam transmitter :-</b></h2>
	  <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of wireless charging systems for electric vehicles has gained significant momentum over the past decade.  In future there will be no need to stop and charge electric vehicles. Instead of it the charging can be done through power beam transmitters which are laid under the roads during the motion of the vehicle. The power beam transmitter will convert electricity into a power beam and then that beam can be transmitted to the moving vehicle with a power beam receiver which then converts the power beam into electrical power for the charging of the battery inside the vehicle.</h5>

	  <h2 class="w3-opacity"><b> Disaster management :-</b></h2>
	  <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  During disasters, we need to be connected with the people. But in those surroundings, all the communication systems and power system gets broken down. Communication during a disaster is an important component of response and recovery; it connects affected people, families, and communities with support systems and other family members. In this situation, an emergency power source may help to provide the necessary power source to power their communication devices so that they can easily connect with their family and rescue services as. A universal power source consists of an airship built-in power transmitter that acts as a power source and drones which consists of the power receiving and transmitting devices that provide basic communication to the affected people. We can also use a remote power supply which is a system for remotely providing power. It supplies power wirelessly to various loads (such as motors) that will wirelessly charge and provide basic power in affected areas.</h5>
          <img src="Future 6.png" class="center"><br>
	  <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wireless power transfer has the potential to change this planet on so many different levels. Here we look at very few of them.  With WPT through resonance and inductive coupling, emerging tech companies are able to broaden the capabilities of most small electronics including cell phones, PDAs, and mp3 players.</h5>
	  <br>
	  <h5>So we can definitely conclude that-</h5>
	  <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> “The power distribution system’s future will be dependent entirely on wireless power transfer.”</b></h5>
